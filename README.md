**MeTooMA** is a dataset containing 9,973 tweets related  to  the  MeToo  movement  that  were  manually  annotated  for  five  different  linguistic  aspects:  **relevance** (relevant, not relevant),  **stance** (support, opposition), **hate speech**  (directed hate, generalized hate), **sarcasm** (sarcastic, not sarcastic), and **dialogue acts** (allegation, refutation, justification). For more details please refer to the paper below.


This repository contains link to download the data, and information about the corpus. Akash, the lead author of the work has also written a wonderful [blog post](https://medium.com/@418akash/a-multi-aspect-view-of-metoo-movement-on-twitter-9fdefae484df) describing the dataset and the rationale behind the study. 


Currently this dataset is a part of the HuggingFace `ðŸ¤—Datasets` library for community usage. This would assist easy sharing and access of this dataset for research purposes. 

The dataset can be obtained from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/JN4EYU

**MeTooMA** is officially now a part of the HuggingFace datasets library. `ðŸ¤—Datasets` is a lightweight and extensible library to easily share and access datasets and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and more. It has many interesting features (beside easy sharing and accessing datasets/metrics):

- Built-in interoperability with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch and Tensorflow 2
- Lightweight and fast with a transparent and pythonic API
- Strive on large datasets: `ðŸ¤—Datasets` naturally frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped on drive by default.
- Smart caching: never wait for your data to process several times

### Installation

`ðŸ¤—Datasets` can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)

```bash
pip install datasets
```

For more details on installation, check the installation page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation.html

### Using with PyTorch/TensorFlow/pandas

If you plan to use `ðŸ¤—Datasets` with PyTorch (1.0+), TensorFlow (2.2+) or pandas, you should also install PyTorch, TensorFlow or pandas.

For more details on using the library with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch or TensorFlow, check the quick tour page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quicktour.html

### Usage

`ðŸ¤—Datasets` is made to be very simple to use. The main methods are:

- `datasets.list_datasets()` to list the available datasets
- `datasets.load_dataset(dataset_name, **kwargs)` to instantiate a dataset
- `datasets.list_metrics()` to list the available metrics
- `datasets.load_metric(metric_name, **kwargs)` to instantiate a metric

Here is a quick example to use **MeTooMA** dataset after installing the `ðŸ¤—Datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import list_datasets, load_dataset, list_metrics, load_metric

# Print all the available datasets
print(list_datasets())

# Load a dataset and print the first examples in the training set
metooma_dataset = load_dataset('metooma')
print(metooma_dataset['train'][0])
{'Allegation': 0, 'Directed_Hate': 0, 'Generalized_Hate': 0, 'Image_Only_Informative': 1, 
'Justification': 1, 'Oppose': 0, 'Refutation': 0, 'Sarcasm': 0, 'Support': 1, 
'Text_Only_Informative': 1, 'TweetId': '1052237153789390853'}


# List all the available metrics
print(list_metrics())
['accuracy', 'bertscore', 'bleu', 'bleurt', 'coval', 'f1', 'gleu', 'glue', 'indic_glue', 'meteor', 
'precision', 'recall', 'rouge', 'sacrebleu', 'seqeval', 'squad', 'squad_v2', 'xnli']

```

We present a detailed account of the data collection and annotation processes. The annotations have a very high inter-annotator agreement (0.79 to 0.93 k-alpha) due to the domain expertise of the annotators and clear annotation instructions. We analyze the data in terms of geographical distribution, label correlations, and keywords. Lastly, we present some potential use cases of this dataset. We expect this dataset would be of great interest to psycholinguists, socio-linguists, and computational linguists to study the discursive space of digitally mobilized social movements on sensitive issues like sexual harassment.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Gautam, Akash and Mathur, Puneet and Gosangi, Rakesh and Mahata, Debanjan and Sawhney, Ramit and Shah, Rajiv Ratn}, year={2020}, month={May}, pages={209-216} }

The {\#}MeToo trend has led to people talking about personal experiences of harassment more openly. This work at- tempts to aggregate such experiences of sex- ual abuse to facilitate a better understanding of social media constructs and to bring about social change. It has been found that disclo- sure of abuse has positive psychological im- pacts. Hence, we contend that such informa- tion can leveraged to create better campaigns for social change by analyzing how users react to these stories and to obtain a better insight into the consequences of sexual abuse. We use a three part Twitter-Specific Social Media Lan- guage Model to segregate personal recollec- tions of sexual harassment from Twitter posts. An extensive comparison with state-of-the-art generic and specific models along with a de- tailed error analysis explores the merit of our proposed model.",

The aggregation and analysis of such disclosures pave the way to development of technology-based prevention of sexual harassment. We contend that the lack of specificity in generic sentence classification models may not be the best way to tackle text subtleties that intrinsically prevail in a classification task as complex as identifying disclosures of sexual harassment. We propose the Disclosure Language Model, a three part ULMFiT architecture, consisting of a Language model, a Medium-Specific (Twitter) model and a Task-Specific classifier to tackle this problem and create a manually annotated real-world dataset to test our technique on this, to show that using a Discourse Language Model often yields better classification performance over (i) Generic deep learning based sentence classification models (ii) existing models that rely on handcrafted stylistic features. An extensive comparison with state-of-the-art generic and specific models along with a detailed error analysis presents the case for our proposed methodology.",
